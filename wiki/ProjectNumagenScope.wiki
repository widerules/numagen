#summary This page is the Project Numagen Scope.

= Project Numagen (PN) Scope=

This project will combine multiple mathematical principles and statical principles into once formula. This formula will be used in to setup the Numagen Algorithm.


= Details =

PN will develop the Numagen application in several different phases.

  * Phase I - Problem & Hypothesis
  * Phase II - Formula Creation & Validation
  * Phase III - Algorithm Generation, Pseudocode, & GUI Interface and Database Design _(Data Integrity and Validation Testing Included)_
  * Phase IV - Pseudocode Translation, Object Defining, & Database Linking _(Data Integrity and Validation Testing Included)_
  * Phase V - Beta Testing & Debugging
  * Phase VI - Release & Review
